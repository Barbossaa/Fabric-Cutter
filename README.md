# Fabric-Cutter
Arduino UNO(C++)

In this project, I used one stepper motor and DC motor (with the DVD player), one Arduino UNO, two lithium-ion batteries (each one is 3.7V), one breadboard power supply, one 5V four-channel relay module that even a two-channel relay module would be enough but I only had that one, 2 switch buttons with pull-down resistors, L298N DC Motor Driver not only to drive the stepper motor but also to energize the relay module's contacts since with battery, the DC motor could draw too much current and a mini breadboard. Also, I got help from the app Fritzing and Arduino IDE for the project.
